# floe-zotero

Infusion grades for working with the Zotero (https://www.zotero.org) API.

At the moment, these are client-side grades that use the [read API](https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/web_api/v3/basics#read_requests), which does not require authentication. Their main intent is:

1) To make it easier to embed a group of resources on a site
2) To make it possible to provide context-specific descriptions of a resource

The demo is the easiest way to see the intent in action.
